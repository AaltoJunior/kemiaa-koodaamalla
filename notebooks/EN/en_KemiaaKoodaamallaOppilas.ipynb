    "_You are a chemist working in the laboratory of a large pharmaceutical company. **Your task is to study drug compounds and compare their properties to those of aspirin.** Water solubility is particularly important, as the drug compound needs to dissolve well in blood. The biological effect and metabolism of the drug compound can be modeled later._\n",
    "\n",
    "_You have already studied many different promising drug compounds without success in the laboratory using demanding solubility tests that depend on the acidity and temperature of the solutions. The project deadline for completing the solubility tests is approaching. Therefore, new ways must be found to determine the best possible drug compounds from the sample for further research and experimentation._\n",
    "\n",
    "_Fortunately, you have access to various laboratory results and modeling tools that pharmaceutical and chemical software developers have been working on for decades. It's time to dive into the world of cheminformatics and solve the water solubility tests before the deadline!_\n"

    "- Code cells, in which commands can be written. Often, before this, they load various libraries that are used to execute commands and processes.\n",
    "- Markdown language cells, which contain text that can be formatted like in a text editor, but with certain **commands** using different characters either before or on both sides of a word.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can edit all cells by double-clicking on the cell and writing commands on the lines or pasting copied text into them with the command. You can run each cell and see the effect of your changes by pressing: **CTRL + ENTER**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter technical problems (for example, a cell does not work), this may be because you have run the cell in a different order than normal. Try to run the cells from top to bottom. If this is not the cause of the problem, use the save command and then press **CTRL + SHIFT + R**. This will reset the notebook. Alternatively, you can run the 'Restart the kernel' command from the top bar."
